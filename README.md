Easy to use Medical/Fitness professional tool

The goal of weightpackage:

1) Calculate your Body mass index during last 6 months.
2) Calculates cardiac blood pressure output by subtracting patient's systolic blood pressure - diastolic blood pressure.
3) Calculates Cardiac Output -> Stroke Volume of patient
4) Recommend health option(s)
5) Create visualization of weight and heart rate.
6) Use R-Calculus to find cross section area of cardiac output.

## Installation

You can install the development version of weightpackage from https://github.com/wallenr8/Final-R.git

``` r
#command install_github("https://github.com/wallenr8/Final-R")```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(weightpackage)
## Cardiac(45)
# Cardiac(20)

#Plot
There isnt a legend, from the source code, it should be note that the area between the Blue line(Optimal cardiac output = 2880 L/m and Red line represents the patient's cardiac output.  No red line means an optimal cardiac output result(40L/m).
```
